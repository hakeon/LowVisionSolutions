		<h3>What is AMD?</h3>
		<p>
			Age-Related Macular Degeneration, or AMD, is a gradual, progressive, painless deterioration of the macula, which is the small area in the center of the retina that gives us our detailed vision.  This is why someone with vision loss from macular degeneration may have trouble reading mail or newspapers but have no trouble spotting an object off to the side or while walking around, even in unfamiliar places.
		</p>
		<h3>What is Like to See With AMD?</h3>
		<p>
			Are you experiencing blurring or a blind spot in the center of your vision? Are you seeing blurry areas on a printed page? Do some straight lines appear wavy? Are there dark spaces or areas in the center of your vision? It might be age-related macular degeneration.
