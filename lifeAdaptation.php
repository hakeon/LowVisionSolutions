		<h3>What Do You Mean by Home and Life Adaptation?</h3>
		<p>
			Your home and lifestyle are who you are, and our goal is to keep you at home, living your life, as safely as possible.
			But Low Vision can challenge you, so we have methods that have been successful by adapting lifestyles and home environments
			to your particular Low Vision challenge.
		<h3>That Sounds Extensive, and Therefore Expensive</h3>
		<p>
			Not necessarily!  In fact, most modifications and adaptations are inexpensive and simple such as:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>picking up throw rugs and rerouting electrical cords</li>
				<li>installing brighter, and more, lights and lightbulbs</li>
				<li>marking edges of stairs, handrails, countertops, and other edges with bright tape</li>
				<li>replacing sheer curtains with blinds to reduce glare</li>
			</ul>
		<p>There are just a few common, easy, inexpensive adaptations that have been helpful for many Low Vision challenges</p>
		<h3>This is Important, How Do I Get a Home Evaluation Scheduled?</h3>
